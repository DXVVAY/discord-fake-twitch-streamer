custom discord twitch streaming link made by dexv
made this cuz was bored really simple code and you can check it that its not a token grabber
open install_requirements.cmd

and then open main.py in visual studio code or other editor of your choice

then put your fake streaming name and link 

then get your discord token and put it in the last line 

then just run run.bat and enjoy

it is running 24/7 for free until you close the file
